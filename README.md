# Assignment-5
For this assignment I downloaded the siscowet.csv data set from the FISH 549 website and created this new repo that held the data set in a data folder and created a figure folder that has an R Markdown file that produces two figures. The first is an exploratory scatter plot that plots fish weight and fish length against each other. The expository figure builds on this previous figure but parses out the fish weight and length trend by location with a linear regression overlayed for each of the locations.
